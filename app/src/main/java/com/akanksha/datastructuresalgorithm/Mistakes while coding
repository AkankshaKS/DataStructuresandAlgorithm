1. In solving second largest question, I did mistake of not mentioning properly arr[i] or i;
example: where I had to mention largest I did mention arr[largest] because of which the code wasn't running.

2. While solving left rotate, I was trying to solve right rotate on LC and wondering why the solution
 was wrong, since on doing right rotate logic has to be a bit different.
